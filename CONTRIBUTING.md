# Contributing to EmbryoLock

Thanks for your interest.

This project is currently in **early, exploratory development**, with a focus on threat modeling, design trade-offs, and practical discussion.

## What Contributions Are Welcome

- Threat model discussion
- Design critiques
- Documentation improvements
- Bug reports and edge-case analysis

At this stage, discussion and review are more valuable than feature expansion.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcome but may not be accepted immediately.

If submitting a PR:
- Clearly describe the intent and trade-offs
- Avoid adding complexity without justification
- Assume changes may be rejected if they expand scope beyond the intended threat model

## Issues

Please use GitHub Issues for:
- Bugs
- Security questions
- Threat model clarification
- Design discussion

## Conduct

Be respectful and technical.  
This project values direct, good-faith critique.

A standard Code of Conduct may be added as the community grows.
