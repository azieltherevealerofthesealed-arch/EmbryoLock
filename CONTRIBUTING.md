# Contributing to EmbryoLock

Thank you for your interest in contributing to EmbryoLock.

This project is open source and fork-friendly, but it follows a strict
integrity and audit-first development model.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the repository
All contributions must come from forks. Direct pushes to protected
branches are not allowed.

### 2. Create a focused change
- One logical change per pull request
- Avoid unrelated refactors
- Keep diffs minimal and reviewable

### 3. Open a Pull Request
- Clearly describe **what changed** and **why**
- Reference any relevant issues
- Generated or automated changes should be explicitly labeled

### 4. Reviews and Approval
- All pull requests require human review
- Automated checks may assist, but do not replace human approval
- Pull requests from forks require explicit approval before workflows run

## Commit Integrity
- Web-based commits require sign-off (DCO-style)
- By contributing, you affirm that you have the right to submit the work
  and that it complies with the project license

## What This Project Is Not
- Not a place for speculative features
- Not a general discussion forum
- Not a rapid-merge environment

## Philosophy
EmbryoLock values:
- Transparency over speed
- Auditability over convenience
- Human custody over automation

If you are unsure whether a change fits, open an issue first.

Thank you for contributing responsibly.

# Contributing to EmbryoLock

Thanks for your interest.

This project is currently in **early, exploratory development**, with a focus on threat modeling, design trade-offs, and practical discussion.

## What Contributions Are Welcome

- Threat model discussion
- Design critiques
- Documentation improvements
- Bug reports and edge-case analysis

At this stage, discussion and review are more valuable than feature expansion.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcome but may not be accepted immediately.

If submitting a PR:
- Clearly describe the intent and trade-offs
- Avoid adding complexity without justification
- Assume changes may be rejected if they expand scope beyond the intended threat model

## Issues

Please use GitHub Issues for:
- Bugs
- Security questions
- Threat model clarification
- Design discussion

## Conduct

Be respectful and technical.  
This project values direct, good-faith critique.

A standard Code of Conduct may be added as the community grows.
