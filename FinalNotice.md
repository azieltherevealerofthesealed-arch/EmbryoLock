EmbryoLock — Final Notice

This repository represents a complete release.

No further versions are required.
No maintainer is designated.
No roadmap is planned.

The code and design are intentionally simple.
They are sufficient as published.

From this point forward:
- Anyone may use, fork, modify, or re-implement this work.
- No permission, coordination, or attribution is required beyond the license.
- Continuation does not depend on the original author.

If this repository remains unchanged, that is by design.
If it disappears, the idea does not.

The project now belongs to whoever finds it useful.

— Consummatum est
