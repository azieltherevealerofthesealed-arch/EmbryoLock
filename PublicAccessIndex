EmbryoLock — Stealth Edition

EmbryoLock is a local, offline file vault designed for situations where data persistence is a liability.

It intentionally prioritizes irreversibility over recovery.

There is no cloud.
There is no account.
There is no reset.
There is no backdoor.

If access fails, the data is destroyed by design.

This tool exists for researchers, journalists, operators, and individuals who understand that in certain threat models, losing data is safer than keeping it.

EmbryoLock is free.
No telemetry.
No tracking.
No analytics.

Use it only if you understand the consequences.
