Public Access Notice

EmbryoLock has been released as fully public access software.
After several days following launch, we determined that the idea itself mattered more than ownership, control, or monetization.
The purpose of EmbryoLock is not profit, prestige, or exclusivity, but the establishment of a moral and practical precedent.
Security, restraint, and personal agency should be available to everyone, not guarded behind paywalls or authority.
We believe accessibility and clarity carry more weight than potential financial return or individual recognition.
This release is an intentional choice to favor unity over competition and service over legacy.
EmbryoLock is offered freely, without obligation, and without expectation.
If it helps one person think more carefully, protect themselves, or act with greater integrity, it has served its purpose.
The work stands on its own and belongs to those who use it responsibly.
